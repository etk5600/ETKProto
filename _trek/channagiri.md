# ABOUT TRIP
read-more: The journey towards Channagiri offers a breathtaking experience as you make your way to the stunning Nandi Hills located close to Bangalore, which is a popular destination for weekend getaways and trekking activities from Bengaluru.

The trail leading to the summit is demanding, but reaching the top makes it all worth it, where you can enjoy your packed lunch while marveling at the captivating views of the Skandigiri and Nandi Hills nearby.
