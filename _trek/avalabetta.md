# ABOUT TRIP
read-more: Avalabetta is a popular hill station located in the Indian state of Karnataka, about 90 kilometers from Bangalore. The scenic beauty of Avalabetta is something that is hard to put into words. It is a perfect getaway from the hustle and bustle of the city, offering a serene and peaceful environment.
more-content: The journey to Avalabetta is itself a wonderful experience. The drive takes you through winding roads, lush green forests, and small villages. The view of the rolling hills and the dense forests along the way is breathtaking, and you can't help but feel closer to nature.<br><br> Gudibande, which means "A temple on top of a rock" in Kannada language, is a fortress constructed in the 17th century by a chieftain named Byre Gowda. It is one of the lesser-known forts in the region and is considered to be a miniature version of the Madhugiri Fort. Although the trek up the Gudibande fort is not as challenging as the Madhugiri fort trail, the panoramic vistas from the summit are unparalleled. <br><br>The pinnacle of the fortress houses an ancient Shiva temple, which contains one of the 108 Jyotirlingas. Upon reaching the top, there are numerous ruins to explore while enjoying breathtaking views of the impressive Byrasagara reservoir.
