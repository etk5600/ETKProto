# ABOUT TRIP
read-more: Channarayana Durga is a hill station located near Tumkur that offers excellent opportunities for trekking and rock climbing. It stands at a height of approximately 1,188 meters and is an ideal destination for those who are interested in exploring forts or uncovering hidden treasures. The hill fort was originally constructed by the Kings of Madhugiri and was later taken over by the Marathas. It was a hotly contested area between the Marathas and the Mysore Wodeyars until the end of the Third Mysore War. Despite many attempts by locals and travelers to find any lost treasures, none have been successful.
more-content: However, for those who enjoy trekking, Channarayanadurga offers a unique challenge. The trek is considered to be of moderate difficulty and begins from a small village located at the base of the hill. The initial climb is steep and lacks any tree cover, making it a strenuous task. Despite the lack of treasure, the hill's rugged terrain offers an equally fulfilling experience for trekkers who are eager to take on the challenge.
