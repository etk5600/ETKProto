# ABOUT TRIP
read-more: Monolith denotes "a massive and tall single block of stone, often carved or erected as a pillar or monument." The fact that Madhugiri Hill, situated in the Tumkur district of Karnataka and approximately 100 kilometers away from Bangalore, is the second-largest monolith in Asia after Savandurga, makes it evident that this trek is no ordinary feat.
more-content: The ascent to Madhugiri Fort is an exceptional experience due to various factors, such as the demanding climb to the summit and the intricate architectural design of the ancient fort visible throughout the trail. Madhugiri was named after the beehive colonies that once resided at the fortress's peak in ancient times. The fort was initially built in 1678 by Raja Heera Gowda of the Ganga Dynasty, and subsequent enhancements were made by Hyder Ali, the de facto Sultan of Mysore at the time. Featuring impressive bastions, gateways, and strategically located water tanks, the Madhugiri Fort exemplifies the warfare techniques employed during those periods.
