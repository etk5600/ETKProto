# ABOUT TRIP
read-more: As you immerse your feet in the tranquil waters flowing from the upper part of Bandaje Arbi and embark on the less-traveled trails of the Kudremukh mountain range towards Ballalarayana Durga Fort, you'll come to the realization that you're engaging in an activity that nourishes your inner being. Trekking has been a popular pursuit in the Chikmagalur district for centuries, but the Ballalarayana Durga Fort and Bandaje Arbi trek remain unspoiled by throngs of people, and their immaculate splendor and idyllic scenery are beckoning to you.
more-content: This trek is located in the Charmadi ghat section of the Western Ghats in the Belthangady taluk of Dakshina Kannada district. Along the way, you'll encounter peaceful and unspoiled landmarks such as Rani Jhari Falls, Ballarayanadurga Fort, and Bandaje Arbi. Over the course of two days, you'll challenge yourself, trek along a stunning route, visit the lively Kodige Falls, and explore the Chennakeshava Temple in Belur, Hassan district. We warmly invite you to embark on this love-filled journey where you can savor every moment and feel fully alive. Take a look at the itinerary and join us on our next adventure.
