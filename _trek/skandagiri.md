# ABOUT TRIP
read-more: Located just 70 KM from Bangalore, Skandagiri is the epitome of a perfect weekend escape for those seeking adventure and breathtaking views. This mountain fortress, also known as Kalwarbetta or Kalavara Durga, holds a rich history dating back to the reign of Tipu Sultan, who built the fortress before losing the Anglo-Mysore War in 1791.
more-content: Despite being abandoned for centuries, the beauty of Skandagiri Hills only continues to grow with time. As restrictions on night treks become increasingly stringent, the Skandagiri trek remains one of the few legally accessible sunrise treks available to explore.<br><br>Take a step back in time and immerse yourself in the rich history and breathtaking views that Skandagiri has to offer. With its close proximity to Bangalore and its picture-perfect sunrise, this trek is a must-do for anyone seeking adventure and a change of scenery.
